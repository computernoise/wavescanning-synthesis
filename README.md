# Wavescanning-Synthesis
Wavescanning Synthesis: This is an adaptation of the wavescanning patch presented in Andy Farnellâ€™s Designing Sound. Wavescanning is a hybrid method situated between waveshaping, granular, and wavetable synthesis. It takes any sound file as a source and uses a triangle or sine wave to index it, creating evolving timbral variations.
